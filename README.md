# SnapChart
An Augmented Reality powered analytical toolkit to enhance interactivity in a collaborative environment.


## Project Abstract
As emerging technology advances during the past decade, more and more cutting edge software, mostly in gaming, have been made available to the general public. This project, on the other hand, has provided another perspective of the usage of Augmented Reality application - Immersive Analytics - in every day team collaboration. In this research, we conducted qualitative contextual inquiries in which insights were addressed and drawn to develop an immersive analytical toolkit prototype, in the form of an AR data visualisation application, and is later proven to helps enhance interactivity in a collaborative environment through expert heuristic evaluation and user testing. We believed that with further refinement, the proposed toolkit, SnapChart, will fill the gap between complex academic research equipment and easy-to-start commercial applications in Immersive Analytics, and furthermore benefit the users' interactivity experiences in a collaborative environment.

### Requirements
- Requires iOS 12 or later
- Optimized for A9 and A10 processors (ARKit 2.0)

### License
For educational purpose only

### Reference
The code of our toolkit was reference from Boris Emorine's AR Bar Chart as well as Apple ARKit official documentation and sample codes.
